# Geothermal System - LED Visualization

Part of the **Carbon Neutral Exhibition** project by [Environmental Dashboard](https://github.com/Environmental-Dashboard).

This component visualizes how a **geothermal heat pump** works in both summer (cooling) and winter (heating) modes using an animated LED strip.

---

## 🎯 What It Shows

A single "globule" travels along the LED strip, changing color to represent **heat transfer**:

### Summer Mode (Cooling)
Heat is extracted FROM the building and dumped INTO the ground.

```
🔴 RED → 🟠 ORANGE → ⚪ WHITE → 🔵 LIGHT BLUE → 🔵 BLUE
(Hot)    (Warm)      (Exchanger) (Cool)         (Cold)
```

### Winter Mode (Heating)
Heat is extracted FROM the ground and pumped INTO the building.

```
🔵 BLUE → 🔵 LIGHT BLUE → ⚪ WHITE → 🟠 ORANGE → 🔴 RED
(Cold)    (Cool)          (Exchanger) (Warm)     (Hot)
```

The system automatically alternates between **4 summer cycles** and **4 winter cycles**, with indicator LEDs showing the current mode.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Quick Reference Table

| Setting | Variable | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| LED Data Pin | `LED_PIN` | 2 | GPIO for LED strip data |
| Number of LEDs | `NUM_LEDS` | 44 | Total LEDs in strip |
| Brightness | `BRIGHTNESS` | 150 | Master brightness (0-255) |
| Animation Speed | `speedMs` | 200 | Delay per step (ms) |
| Summer Indicator | `SUMMER_PIN` | 4 | GPIO for summer LED |
| Winter Indicator | `WINTER_PIN` | 5 | GPIO for winter LED |
| Color Order | `COLOR_ORDER` | RGB | Try GRB if colors wrong |

### 📏 Changing Segment Distances

The globule changes color after traveling a set number of LEDs. Adjust these values to match your physical display:

```cpp
// Outbound journey (phases 0-4)
#define d1   5    // RED zone
#define d2   5    // ORANGE zone
#define d3   7    // WHITE zone
#define d4   5    // LIGHT BLUE zone
#define d5   5    // BLUE zone

// Return journey (phases 5-9)
#define d6   2    // BLUE zone
#define d7   3    // LIGHT BLUE zone
#define d8   2    // WHITE zone
#define d9   3    // ORANGE zone
#define d10  2    // RED zone
```

**Total LEDs used:** d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 + d8 + d9 + d10 = 39

### 🎨 Changing Colors

Colors are defined using RGB values (0-255 for each channel):

```cpp
#define S_RED        CRGB::Red              // (255, 0, 0)
#define S_ORANGE     CRGB(255, 120, 0)      // Warm orange
#define S_WHITE      CRGB(255, 220, 200)    // Warm white
#define S_LIGHTBLUE  CRGB(0, 80, 255)       // Cool blue
#define S_BLUE       CRGB::Blue             // (0, 0, 255)
```

**Color Mixing Guide:**

| Desired Color | RGB Value |
|---------------|-----------|
| Pure Red | `CRGB(255, 0, 0)` |
| Orange | `CRGB(255, 120, 0)` |
| Yellow | `CRGB(255, 255, 0)` |
| Warm White | `CRGB(255, 220, 200)` |
| Cool White | `CRGB(200, 220, 255)` |
| Light Blue | `CRGB(0, 80, 255)` |
| Pure Blue | `CRGB(0, 0, 255)` |

### ⏱️ Changing Animation Speed

```cpp
int speedMs = 200;  // milliseconds per LED step
```

| Value | Speed | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 50-100 | Fast | Energetic, attention-grabbing |
| 150-250 | Medium | Easy to follow (default) |
| 300-500 | Slow | Dramatic, meditative |

---

### 🔄 Changing Number of Cycles

By default, the system runs **4 cycles** in each mode before switching. To change:

```cpp
// In loop() function:
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {   // ← Change 4 to desired number
    runGlobuleCycle(false);
}
```

## 🚀 Uploading the Code

1. Connect ESP32 via USB cable (must be data cable, not power-only)
2. Select correct COM port in **Tools → Port**
3. Click **Upload** button
4. If upload fails:
   - Hold the **BOOT** button on ESP32 while uploading
   - Release when upload starts
   - Try lowering upload speed to 115200

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Colors look wrong | Change `COLOR_ORDER` to `GRB` or `BGR` |
| LEDs flicker | Add 1000µF capacitor across 5V and GND |
| First LED wrong color | Add 300-500Ω resistor on data line |
| No LEDs light up | Check wiring, power supply, pin number |
| Upload fails | Hold BOOT button, lower upload speed |
| Too bright/dim | Adjust `BRIGHTNESS` (0-255) |
| Animation too fast/slow | Adjust `speedMs` |

## 🌡️ How Geothermal Heat Pumps Work

This display demonstrates the real-world process:

**Summer (Cooling Mode):**
1. Indoor unit absorbs heat from building air
2. Heat pump compresses refrigerant (adds more heat)
3. Heat is transferred to ground loop fluid
4. Fluid carries heat underground where it's absorbed by earth
5. Cooled fluid returns to repeat cycle

**Winter (Heating Mode):**
1. Ground loop extracts heat from underground (earth stays ~55°F year-round)
2. Heat pump concentrates this low-grade heat
3. Heat is released into building air
4. Cooled fluid returns underground to collect more heat

The LED animation shows this heat transfer process with colors representing temperature!
